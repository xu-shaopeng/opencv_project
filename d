Subject: Inquiry Regarding the Status of My Manuscript Review Process

Dear [Editor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Xu shaopeng, and I am writing to kindly inquire about the status of my manuscript, titled "A small sample detection method for the appearance quality of Cistanche seeds based on YOLOv5," which I submitted to "Journal of Food Process Engineering" . The manuscript tracking number assigned to my submission is [JFPE-2024-Mar-0326], if that helps in retrieving the relevant information.

Since submitting my work, I have been eagerly awaiting updates on its progress through the peer-review process. I understand that the review cycle can vary and appreciate the dedication and time invested by the reviewers and editorial team in ensuring the quality of publications. However, given the importance of this research to my academic pursuits and potential impact on the field, I am keen to know if there have been any developments or if any further action is required from my side.

Specifically, I would appreciate any of the following information, if available:

Current Stage: Whether the manuscript has been assigned to reviewers, whether any initial reviews have been received, or if the process is still in its early stages.
Anticipated Timeline: An estimated timeline for when I might expect to receive the reviewers' comments or a decision on the manuscript.
Additional Information: If there are any concerns or clarifications needed from my side to facilitate the review process, I am more than willing to provide them promptly.
Please note that I am fully committed to addressing any feedback or revisions required to strengthen the manuscript and am eager to engage in a constructive dialogue with the reviewers and editorial team.

Thank you for your time and consideration in addressing my inquiry. I understand the demands on your schedule and appreciate your efforts in managing the numerous submissions. I look forward to hearing from you soon and remain hopeful for a favorable outcome.

Warm regards,
